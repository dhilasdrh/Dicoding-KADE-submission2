# KADE-submission2
This is my submission for the second assessment project in Dicoding "Kotlin Android Developer Expert" course. In the second part of this course, we have learned how to display data from an API and also apply MVP patterns. In order to proceed to the next module, we need to submit the project with some predetermined criteria. If in the previous submission you only use local data to be displayed, this time the data to be displayed is data that comes from the API, TheSportDB.

### Application Criteria
Some features that must be modified or added to the application:

* Maintain the previous submission feature
* League listing and details page
* **Match Schedule** : Displays the list of matches (Next Match and Previous Match) of the league chosen by the user with data obtained from the API.
* **Match Details** : Displays match details (team logos, scores and other information) of selected matches with data obtained from the API.
* **Match Search** : Feature to search soccer matches.

The opportunity for your submission to be accepted will be greater if:
* Display complete information on the league details page.
* Use Fragments to hold the Next Match and Previous Match pages.
* Displays complete information on the match details page.
* Displays the loading indicator when the application is loading data.
* Use patterns like MVP, MVVM, Architecture Component or others.
* Displays the match time in GMT +7 format.
* Use SearchView to implement search features.
* Displays information to the user when a search result was not found.
* Write the code clean.
